                So how do you make something like that? Start by checking out the Django doc on Custom template tags and filters. It's a little more difficult to get started than the rest of Django, but once you get it, it's pretty Easy.
                <div class='post_sig'>
                    <a href='#'>three minutes ago</a>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class='content_post'>
                Using template tags would probably be the route I would take here. I've had a similar situation to this, whereby I had calendar information being rendered multiple times in different formats on the same page. The way I handled it was by passing the queried data into the request context, then simply using that queryset as an argument of a template tag. The result is that you can end up with template syntax like this
                <div class='post_sig'>
                    <a href='#'>two hours ago</a>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class='content_post'>
                 #!usr/bin/python <br> Uses libevent API directly and thus may be dangerous. WSGI interface is a safer alternative and should be used if possible, see examples/wsgiserver.py
                <div class='post_sig'>
                    <a href='#'>8:30pm 6.12.2010</a>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
